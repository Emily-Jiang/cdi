=== Bean archive in Java SE

When running in Java SE, the container must extend the rules defined in <<bean_archive_full>> and also ensure that :

An archive which doesn't contain a `beans.xml` file can't be discovered as an _implicit bean archive_ unless:

* the application is launched with system property `jakarta.enterprise.inject.scan.implicit` set to `true`, or
* the container was initialized with a map containing an entry parameter with `jakarta.enterprise.inject.scan.implicit` as key and `Boolean.TRUE` as value.
